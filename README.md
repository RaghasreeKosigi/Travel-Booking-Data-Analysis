# Travel-Booking-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data for a travel booking platform to understand customer booking behavior, seasonal trends, cancellation patterns, and pricing insights. The analysis supports data-driven business decisions related to revenue optimization and operational planning.

## Business Problem
Travel booking platforms often face challenges such as high cancellation rates, fluctuating demand across seasons, and difficulties in pricing optimization. Analyzing historical booking data helps businesses reduce revenue loss and improve customer experience.

## Objectives
- Analyze hotel booking data to identify demand patterns
- Understand seasonal trends based on arrival months
- Study cancellation behavior to reduce revenue loss
- Analyze Average Daily Rate (ADR) to support pricing decisions

## Tools Used
- **SQL** – Data querying and analysis  
- **WEKA** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Power BI** – Basic dashboard visualization  
- **MS Word** – Documentation  

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Hotel Type Analysis
- Compared bookings between City Hotels and Resort Hotels
- Identified distribution of bookings across hotel types using WEKA visualizations

### 2. Arrival Date Month Analysis
- Analyzed monthly booking trends to identify seasonality
- Used WEKA attribute selection and graphical representation for all months

### 3. Cancellation Analysis
- Studied cancelled vs confirmed bookings
- Identified cancellation patterns using SQL queries and WEKA visualizations

### 4. Average Daily Rate (ADR) Analysis
- Calculated average daily rate using SQL
- Analyzed pricing trends to understand revenue behavior

## Deliverables
- SQL queries with outputs
- Exploratory Data Analysis screenshots using WEKA
- Basic Power BI dashboard
- Detailed analysis report documentation

## Outcome
The project provides meaningful insights into booking trends, seasonality, cancellations, and pricing behavior, helping stakeholders make informed business and operational decisions.
